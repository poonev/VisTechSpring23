Project: MoMA Mies van der Rohe: Medium Study

Vis Tech Spring 2023

Summary Image:

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City has extensive datasets on their collections and artists available to the public. Within the MoMA’s “Artworks” collection, this project focuses specifically on one particular artist: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. 

Mies van der Rohe was a German American architect and furniture designer and regarded as “one of the pioneers of modernist architecture." He created numerous projects ranging from furniture to architecture to art, using a variety of mediums such as pen, pencil, printmaking, watercolor, and much more. From domestic spaces like the famous Barcelona Pavilion to large, large-scale office towers like New York City’s Seagram Building, he imbued his buildings with a fluid spatial harmony reflective of his oft-quoted aphorism, “less is more.” Mies van der Rohe is currently the 3rd most represented artist in the MoMA collection.

By looking at Mies van der Rohe's works, we want to understand the quantity of artworks produced by Mies van der Rohe (collected by the MoMA), the variety of mediums he used to create these artworks, and if there was a change in mediums as he continued to produce more works.
